🏡 Quirex

“A Smart MERN-based Real Estate Platform to Buy, Sell, and Manage Properties with Ease.”
Quirex is a Real Estate Web Application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It provides a seamless platform where users can buy or sell properties and admins can manage the entire system efficiently.

The project focuses on delivering a modern, secure, and user-friendly interface with personalized dashboards for both Admin and User roles.

👤 Users can register, login, browse available properties, purchase or list their properties, and manage their personal profiles.

🛠 Admins have a dedicated dashboard to add, update, or delete properties, view buyers/sellers lists, and monitor the overall system.

With its clean design and robust functionality, Quirex serves as a smart solution for real estate management, ensuring transparency, convenience, and efficiency for both users and administrators.
